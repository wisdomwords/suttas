The Advantage of Friendship
(Mettanisamsa)
============
*This poem is taken from the Muga-Pakkha Jataka, "The Birth-Story of the Dumb Cripple"(Jataka 538). In this story the Bodhisatta was born as Prince Temiya, son of the king of Kasi(Benares)
. IN infancy the price realized that, if he ever succeeded to his father, he would be forced by his position to perform unwholesome actions and therefore to suffer in future. As a way to avoid tht, he pretended to be completely paralyzed, deaf and dumb. He kept up the ruse so well that after a number of years the king decided that Temiya must be put to death. As the executioner the king appointed Sunanda, a charioteer. Sunanda carried the prince off to the forest and started to dig a grave before killing the boy. While he was doing so, Temiya at last decided to drop the pretense and spoke the following poem, asking that his life be spared. Astounded by the prince's revelation of his nature, Sunanda offered to bring him back to court, where Temiya could regain his position as heir to the throne. Temiya refused, however, explaining the reason for his pretense. The charioteer returned alone to the capital to fetch the king and his court. Following Temiya, they all decided to forsake worldly life and become recluses, devoting themselves to purifying their minds*
 
While fulfilling the necessary conditions for enlightenment in his birth as Temiya, the Lord spoke of the advantages of friendship to his charioteer named Sunanda. For the good and benefit of all the world, let us recite this protective verse.
 
* Well-feasted when absent from his home, for many he provides support -- he who does not betray friends.
* In whatever land he goes, small town or royal city, everywhere he is honored -- he who does not betray friends.
* Thieves do not overpower him, no prince can slight him, he overcomes all enemies -- he who does not betray friends.
* He returns to his home in peace, he is deferred to by relatives -- he who does not betray friends.
* Being hospitable, he receives hospitality; esteeming others he is esteemed; he receives praise and admiration -- he who does not betray friends.
* Respecting others, he respected; honoring others, he honored; he attains fame and renown -- he who does not betray friends.
* Like fire he shines forth; like a celestial being he radiant; never abandoned by fortune is he who does not betray friends.
* His cattle increase, his fields yield abundant crops, he enjoys the fruit of what he has sown -- he who does not betray friends.
* Should he fall into a chasm or from a mountain or tree, that (stalwart) man will find firm footing though he is brought low -- he who does not betray friends.
* As a gale [cannot harm] the banyan tree, matured in root and crown, so enemies have no power over one who does not betray friends.
